# Type Parameters vs Type Members

I gave a talk about path dependent types at
[ScalaSyd](http://www.meetup.com/scalasyd/events/229271693/).  

It was an exploration of the situations where
type members are superior to type parameters
(and visa versa).  

Here are the [slides](pdts-talk.html) and the example
[code](https://bitbucket.org/a4dev/pdts/src).  

The code includes a simplified HMap, rule system and reducer/transducer system
plus example data.  And it is all self contained (ie no external libraries).

I spent an afternoon cutting the code down to the minimum so that it could
all be shown in the talk (except the two files called  ex?annex.scala).
