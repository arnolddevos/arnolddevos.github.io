# About This Web Site

I am in the process of refreshing this site.  (Oct 10 2013)  It is currently produced using a static site generator called [Soapbox](/posts/Soapbox/Soapbox.html)

### Updated Mar 23 2018

I have moved this material to github pages, partly to get hassle-free HTTPS and partly because after 5 years Soapbox needs and update.  It is currently produced with Jekyll.
