# An Update to the Scala Jetty Wrapper

The JettyS library [http://github.com/arnolddevos/JettyS](http://github.com/arnolddevos/JettyS) has been updated for Scala 2.8.  There is also a workaround for a bug in Jetty 6 associated with `setLowResourceMaxIdleTime()`.   An update to Jetty 7 is coming.

See [Pimping Servlet and Jetty](Pimping_Servlet_and_Jetty.html) for more information about this library.
